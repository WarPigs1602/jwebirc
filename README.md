# jwebirc
 As an example can you try the webirc on https://irc.midiandmore.net/jwebirc/?channels=dev <br>
<br>
 This is an qwebirc clone, written in java as jsp, servlet and javascript.<br>
 You can download and extract the [jwebirc.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18517075/jwebirc.zip) file on your server.<br>
 This package contains the jwebirc.war file.<br>
 To run it, please install [tomcat10](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi) and [jre17](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/downloads/) (As alternative can you use [openjdk17](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/23/)) or higher.<br>
 To install the war archive, just start tomcat and copy/move the jwebirc.war to the tomcat/webapps/ folder. Then can you go in the tomcat/webapps/jwebirc/ folder and modify the config.jsp and then will it works with an IRC server.<br>
<br>
 For further webirc configuration on [snircd](https://github.com/quakenet/snircd), is the [mIAuthd](https://github.com/WarPigs1602/mIAuthd) package recommened.<br>
 On [ircu](https://github.com/UndernetIRC/ircu2), [midircd](https://github.com/WarPigs1602/midircd)  and other ircd's, is the option to configure the ircd with the webchat feature included, and an IAuthd isn't needed.<br>
<br>
 Have fun with this package!<br>
